### Crude Oil Flow Pattern 
## Project Proposal
How does the flow of crude oil Imports & Exports shipments seem to be relate in oil prices. 
Quoting from the WTI, Brent pricing standards from the EIA a government agency and Clifford third party data.
Does the variation of price between crude oil (WTI and Brent) relate to volume of imports and exports of crude?
Project Team:Amy McMahon, Carlos Maqueda,  Luke Gonzales, Madelaine Davis
## Other Questions?
Is there a correlation to increase oil prices when there are time periods of increase of US oil exports to the other countries?
How good is the third party data (Clipper) at accurately tracking import and export crude oil volume?
The analysis of crude oil movement by:
•	Grade
•	Vessel class	
•	Year 
•	Country
## Analysis Method
To test these questions, we decided to use the following data and take the following approach in creating interactive analysis on a time period 2011-2019:
1.	EIA US Crude Inventory (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). API (Key acquired)
2.	Thomson DataStream
3.	Clipper third party data set. CSV (access acquired)
4.	Concentration on US vs international
5.	Country full names provided in data sets
6.	Visual created with plotly on Hosted on heruko.app
7.	Source code will be published on Git hub https://github.com/cjmaqueda/crude_oil_flow_pattern
